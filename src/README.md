There's really not much to see now. Just a bootstrapped React app that gets the users GPS coordinates and hits a Google Maps API.

Eventually, I want it to allow users to tag stores they're physically at and publish what Legends figures they currently have in stock. You'll be able to filter by figure, store, and most recent data.

But yeah, right now it's just a web app that gets your location and shows it on a map :/
